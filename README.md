# 🔐 Rail Fence Cipher + Image Steganography  
**Cryptography Practical #5 – M.Tech Cyber Security (RRU)**  

---

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the **Rail Fence Transposition Cipher** and implement it in **Python** with **Image Steganography (LSB method)**, along with a **web-based decryption tool** hosted on GitHub Pages.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Rail Fence transposition cipher (zigzag pattern encryption)
- Encryption and decryption functions with variable rail count  
- Image steganography (LSB embedding and extraction)
- Web-based decryption using HTML + JavaScript
- GitHub Pages deployment for cryptography visualization

## 🖼️ Image Stego Example

1. Input image: `logo.png`  
2. Encrypted text: `MJRANII`  
3. Output stego image: `stego.png`

The ciphertext is hidden inside the image pixels using LSB (Least Significant Bit) modification.
